This is a list of skills and modern technology currently in the front-end sphere, it covers mindset, technology and operations. 

These skills cover a big range of dev-ops, which gives you a lot of control of how you setup your projects for ease of development. 
As well as ensure you write clean, secure, modern and scalable code. 

Programming Conventions:
===============

These are skills that are more down to a way of thinking, approaching a solution than actually knowing technical details or solutions indepth. 

**Data Driven** - Being able to look at data from tools like Hotjar, AB testing tools, raw analytics etc and being able to see patterns and opportunities to optimize and change. 

- Reading user flow information
- Pattern spotting

**Test Driven Development** - Very common nowadays is first writing your unit tests, then writing your unit to pass the tests. 

If you have a clear goal on what unit a should do, what it should be scoped to and what it's likely to be encounted by. You can then write the unit tests first and ensure it passes all these cases, it's a very powerful approach to ensuring a high-standard of code and adds fail-safes from the get-go. 

- Writing code that you can write unit tests for, both as a whole unit and as separate parts of the unit is important, regardless of TDD. 

**Reactive & Functional Programming** - These 2 paradigms are not directly interconnected but i am simply grouping them.

Knowing the cores of both of these paradigms and how to use them are essential in a lot of modern javascript.

- Higher order functions
- Factory Functions
- Map
- Reduce
- Closures
- Currying
- Recursion
- Promises
- Async / Await functions
- Observing
- Streams

**Object Oriented programming** - Considering javascript does it differently with prototypical inheritance and a new ES6 Class syntax, it's important to know OOP in general and how javascript handles that type of programming. 

- OOP Practices in general
- Prototypical inheritance (Javascript)
- ES6+ Classes (Syntactic sugar for prototypes, even with this syntax it is important to know prototypes)
- Object Create
- Instancing in javascript

Design Patterns:
==================
These help you structure your applications in a way that makes sense, there is a few design patterns out there. 
You have the more common patterns like Composition and Inheritance but also: 

- Observer Design Pattern
- Prototype Design Pattern
- Singletons & Modular Design Patterns


Javascript Knowledge:
=====================

These skills focus more on javascript itself or tied to developing with javascript.

**ES6:**

- Const / let (and when to use which)
- Arrow Functions
- Modules
- Spread operators
- Destructing
- Arrow Functions
- Template Strings
- Object Assign


**ES7/8**:

- Observables
- Async / Await functions

There is more to these language updates, but covering these are essential.

**Typescript**:
Introduces some nice functionality and strong typing to javascript, basic familiarity will serve you well with this. 
It is also a super-set of javascript and will require transpiling to run in browser. 


Architectural Javascript Knowledge:
===================================

Being familiar with these practises will help a lot. 

- Application Store
- State & State management 
- Event Pub/Sub
- Pure modular structure - With scaling in mind
- Dependency Injection (ties into NPM / ES6 +)
- Shadow DOM / Web Components
- Smart / Dumb Components convention
- CSS Module convention

Operations Knowledge:
=====================

These focus more on building the environment for good development practises and ease of use. 

- NPM Packages (important)
- EsLinting + Using it in your editor
- Node Scripts (building, watching etc)
- Post CSS
- Webpack 
- Treeshaking practises (ties into modular architecture)
- Babel - Transpiling
- Polyfilling - Web components

Tooling Knowledge:
==================

This focuses more on tools you should be aware of, basic understanding of how they work, what problem they solve etc. Each one solves problems differently or different problems and has different drawbacks. Knowing these gives you some key insight to building lasting javascript products and choosing the right tools for different purposes.

- nodeJs - front-end / back-end library / framework / tool
- ExpressJs - back-end library / framework / tool (introduces good middleware practices)
- mongoDb - front-end library / framework / tool
- reactJs - front-end library / framework / tool
- Angular 4 - front-end library / framework / tool
- Vue - front-end library / framework / tool
- Redux - state management
- Mocha - testing
- Chai - testing
- Phantomjs - testing
- jsDom - testing
- avaJs - Testing 
- Docker - Instancing

**Progressive Web Apps:**
This bridges native mobile experiences with websites and web-apps, giving rich features and nice optimizations.

**Web Components:**
This brings very nice technology to the web, making development easier or introducing rich features or optimizations.
